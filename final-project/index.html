            <p>
                It’s looking like a battle of the heavyweights at the 2025 Grammy Awards, as Recording Academy darlings
                Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Billie Eilish all released major albums and singles during the eligibility
                period (September 16, 2023, to August 30, 2024). Commercial titans Post Malone, Sabrina Carpenter,
                Chappell Roan, and Eminem are also likely locks for nominations. Keeping in mind the industry favorites
                and some of Pitchfork’s own favorite music since late last year, here is a breakdown of potential Grammy
                nominees, a mix of longshots and safe bets to reflect the academy’s tendency to mix a surprise or two
                into the field of chart-toppers. Stay tuned for the final nominations on Friday, November 8.
            </p>
            <h5>Album of the Year</h5>
            <li>Beyoncé - Cowboy Carter</li>
            <li>Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard and Soft</li>
            <li>Brittany Howard - What Now</li>
            <li>Chappell Roan - The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</li>
            <li>Charli XCX - Brat</li>
            <li>Sufjan Stevens - Javelin</li>
            <li>Taylor Swift - The Tortured Poets Department</li>
            <li>Vampire Weekend - Only God Was Above Us</li>
            <p>
                Let’s start with the easy ones. Billie Eilish’s first two albums were nominated for Album of the Year
                (and her debut won the award!), so she’ll get nominated. Taylor Swift is also coming off an Album of the
                Year victory for "Midnights." And Beyoncé, despite never having won in the major album category, is
                perennially a nominee and, generally, the winningest artist in Grammys history. After that, the field
                opens up a little, but it still feels safe to assume that breakout star Chappell Roan will make another
                splash with an Album of the Year nod. And, if the Democratic candidate for president “IS brat,” then
                maybe the Grammys ARE brat, too.

                With the major pop figures out of the way, there could be room for alternative and indie stars to get
                nominations. Vampire Weekend vaulted from the alternative to general category, in 2020, with "Father of
                the Bride," and a repeat for "Only God Was Above Us" is deserved. Brittany Howard’s "What Now" could be
                too sonically diverse to fit a single genre category, making it a good candidate for Album of the Year,
                a category where she and Alabama Shakes were nominated at the 2016 Grammys. Lastly, Sufjan Stevens may
                be the darkest of the dark horses, with his lone Grammy nomination coming years ago for the "Call Me by
                Your Name" standard “Mystery of Love.” But the heart-wrenching "Javelin" could benefit from the
                mainstream appreciation and acclaim of the Illinoise musical.

            <h5>Record of the Year</h5>
            <li>Beyoncé - Texas Hold 'Em</li>
            <li>Chappell Roan - Good Luck, Babe!</li>
            <li>Kendrick Lamar - Not Like Us</li>
            <li>Post Malone Featuring Morgan Wallen - I Had Some Help</li>
            <li>Sabrina Carpenter - Espresso</li>
            <li>Taylor Swift Featuring Post Malone - Fortnight</li>
            <li>Tems - Me & U</li>
            <li>Tinashe - Nasty</li>
            <p>
                As always, there are some very obvious contenders for Record of the Year at the 2025 Grammys; the songs
                that chase you from the gym, to CVS, to your late-night Uber (Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso,” Chappell
                Roan’s “Good Luck, Babe!”). The unexpected crossover smash hit (Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had
                Some Help”). And, of course, songs by Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, which seem to float straight from pop’s
                Mount Olympus and onto the Grammy ballot, inked in gold. Kendrick Lamar—a decorated Grammy winner and
                distinguished man of letters—will probably make the list for his seismic, scathing Drake diss track “Not
                Like Us.” (If he wins it, there’s no telling when that beef will be squashed.) Miley Cyrus’ mostly
                palatable dance track “Flowers” nabbed Record of the Year in February, proving that Grammy voters often
                gobble up the softest and safest pop. If they’re looking for something that’s melodic with real
                emotional depth and dynamic production, “Me & U,” by Afropop star Tems, could break the category’s tepid
                run from Silk Sonic to Lizzo to Cyrus. Or, we can admit that fun and slutty pop songs still reign
                supreme, and give Tinashe her crown for “Nasty.”

            <li>Charli XCX & Lorde - Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde</li>

                An annual reminder, the distinction between Record of the Year and Song of the Year is small but
                important. The former category is about a track’s entire recording, and the latter recognizes the
                songwriting. Nevertheless, there is typically a great deal of overlap between the categories. For our
                purposes, the winks and innuendos of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” are sure to appeal to the
                songwriters of the Recording Academy. And “Girl, So Confusing Featuring Lorde” is both irresistible and
                self-referential. If the Grammys really wanted to reward expert songwriting, though, they’d look to
                Jessica Pratt’s “Life Is.”

            <h5>Best New Artist</h5>
            <li>Cash Cobain</li>
            <li>Chappell Roan</li>
            <li>Mannequin Pussy</li>
            <li>Mk.gee</li>
            <li>Sabrina Carpenter</li>
            <li>Shaboozey</li>
            <li>Teddy Swims</li>
            <li>Tommy Richman</li>
            <p>
                Given the ubiquity of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” and the expanding reign of reluctant pop star
                Chappell Roan, their Best New Artist nominations are nearly mandatory. Roan earned the title at this
                year’s MTV Video Music Awards, and her jet-propelled ascent from Midwest princess to chart-topping diva
                make her more than eligible for a nod from the Recording Academy. Carpenter has been releasing music for
                over a decade, but the Grammy guidelines for Best New Artist require only that nominees haven’t
                experienced a “breakthrough or prominence” before the eligibility period. She certainly had not.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this category always has its share of shiny and new populist faves; polished, melodic crooners like
                Shaboozey, Tommy Richman, and Teddy Swims could well make the Best New Artist class of 2025, especially
                the latter two, who rose to fame via TikTok and YouTube, respectively. Singer-songwriter and guitarist
                Mk.gee, who has garnered praise from Eric Clapton and John Mayer, and is working with Justin Bieber,
                seems primed for the nomination, too. New York rapper Cash Cobain, whose sexy drill album "Play Cash
                Cobain" solidified his prominence as an emcee and producer, should also be considered in a sea of more
                straightforward pop potentials. If the Grammys really wanted to toss in an outlier, they’d nominate
                Philadelphia punks Mannequin Pussy, who are, in fact, vying for nomination. It’s rare for an underground
                act to secure the Best New Artist bag, but the nomination alone would be a game-changing career booster.

                    "Sure, there’s technically a definition justifying what is and isn’t 'alternative' enough to qualify
                    for Best Alternative Music Album at the Grammys, but it reads more like a vibe check–turned–diss
                    track against the other categories: 'a genre of music that embraces attributes of progression and
                    innovation… [that’s] typically more original, eclectic, or musically challenging.'"

                    Best to think of it as the lunch table at art school where all the popular kids sit. Too quiet for
                    Best Rock Album? Of course you’re welcome here, Vampire Weekend’s "Only God Was Above Us" and the
                    Smile’s "Wall of Eyes." Too artsy for Best Americana or Best Folk Album? These seats are exclusively
                    reserved for Waxahatchee’s "Tigers Blood" and Adrianne Lenker’s "Bright Future." But the coolest
                    pick in the category goes to the true unpinnable act, the one who’s outside of genres altogether yet
                    could hold its own in three different categories anyway: L’Rain’s "I Killed Your Dog." If Best
                    Alternative Music Album really is about the records that challenge definition and musically
                    shapeshift on each listen, then let Taja Cheek’s third full-length flex already.
