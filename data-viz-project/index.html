        <h1>Top NFL Offensive Players in the 2024-2025 Season So Far</h1>
        <h2>Players to Watch Closely This Season</h2>
        <h3>By KC Duru</h3>
        <p>
            These charts take a look at what NFL offensive players are leading in passing and rushing yards in the
            2024-2025 season as of Nov. 5, 2024. These specific statistics are indicative of the strength of a team's
            offense. To this point, it's worth noting that eight of the
            <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team" target="_blank">top 10 offensive teams</a> are represented in
            at least one of the charts depicted below. Additionally, three of the top 10 offensive teams are represented
            in both of these charts.
